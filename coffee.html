              We want to do a lot of stuff. We are not in great shape. We didn't get a good night rest. We are a little depressed.
              Coffee solves all of these problems in one delightful cup.

                Coffee preparation is the process of turning coffee beans into a beverage. While the particular steps vary
                with the type of coffee and with the raw materials, the process includes four basic steps: raw coffee beans
                must be <a href="roasting.html">roasted</a>, the roasted coffee beans must then be <a href="grinding.html">ground</a>, and the ground coffee must then be mixed with
                hot or cold water (depending on the method of <a href="brewing.html">brewing</a>) for a specific time (brewed), the liquid coffee extraction must be separated from the used grounds.
            </p>

                Coffee is usually brewed immediately before drinking.In most areas, coffee may be purchased
                unprocessed, or already roasted, or already roasted and ground. Whole roast coffee or ground coffee is often vacuum packed to prevent
                oxidation and lengthen its shelf life.
