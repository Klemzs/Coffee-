        <p>The whole coffee beans are ground, also known as milling, to facilitate the brewing process.</p>

        <p>The fineness of the grind strongly affects brewing. Brewing methods that expose coffee grounds to
            heated water for longer require a coarser grind than faster brewing methods. Beans that are too finely
            ground for the brewing method in which they are used will expose too much surface area to the heated
            water and produce a bitter, harsh, "over-extracted" taste. At the other extreme, an overly coarse grind will
            produce weak coffee unless more is used. Due to the importance of a grind's fineness, a uniform grind is
            highly desirable.</p>

        <p>If a brewing method is used in which the time of exposure of the ground coffee to the heated water is
            adjustable, then a short brewing time can be used for finely ground coffee. This produces coffee of equal
            flavor yet uses less ground coffee. A blade grinder does not cause frictional heat buildup in the ground 
            coffee unless used to grind very large amounts as in a commercial operation. A fine grind allows the most
            efficient extraction but coffee ground too finely will slow down filtration or screening.</p>

        <p>Ground coffee deteriorates faster than roasted beans because of the greater surface area exposed to
            oxygen. Many coffee drinkers grind the beans themselves immediately before brewing.</p>

        <p>
            There are four(4) methods of grinding coffee for brewiing:
            <ul>
            <li>Burr-grinding</li>
            <li>Chopping</li>
            <li>Pounding</li>
            <li> Roller Grinding</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
