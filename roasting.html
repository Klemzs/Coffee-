        <h3>Commercial Coffee Roaster</h3>

        <p>Roasting coffee transforms the chemical and physical properties of green coffee beans. When roasted, the
        green coffee bean expands to nearly double its original size, changing in color and density. As the bean 
        absorbs heat, its color shifts to yellow, then to a light "cinnamon" brown, and then to a rich dark brown color.
        During roasting, oils appear on the surface of the bean. The roast will continue to darken until it is removed
        from the heat source.</p>

        <p>Coffee can be roasted with ordinary kitchen equipment (frying pan, grill, oven, popcorn popper) or by
        specialised appliances. A coffee roaster is a special pan or apparatus suitable to heat up and roast
        green coffee beans.</p>
